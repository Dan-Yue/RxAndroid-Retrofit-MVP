<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><!--drawable:Drawable 资源。必须的。引用一个drawable资源。--><!--scaleGravity:指定缩放后gravity的位置 必须是下面的一个或多个值（多个值之间用”|“分隔），下面的值和描述和上一篇的ClipDrawable一样。
值	描述
top	Put the object at the top of its container, not changing its size.
bottom	Put the object at the bottom of its container, not changing its size.
left	Put the object at the left edge of its container, not changing its size. This is thedefault.
right	Put the object at the right edge of its container, not changing its size.
center_vertical	Place object in the vertical center of its container, not changing its size.
fill_vertical	Grow the vertical size of the object if needed so it completely fills its container.
center_horizontal	Place object in the horizontal center of its container, not changing its size.
fill_horizontal	Grow the horizontal size of the object if needed so it completely fills its container.
center	Place the object in the center of its container in both the vertical and horizontal axis, notchanging its size.
fill	Grow the horizontal and vertical size of the object if needed so it completely fills itscontainer.
clip_vertical	Additional option that can be set to have the top and/or bottom edges of the child clipped toits container's bounds. The clip is based on the vertical gravity: a top gravity clips thebottom edge, a bottom gravity clips the top edge, and neither clips both edges.
clip_horizontal	Additional option that can be set to have the left and/or right edges of the child clipped toits container's bounds. The clip is based on the horizontal gravity: a left gravity clipsthe right edge, a right gravity clips the left edge, and neither clips both edges.--><!--scaleHeight:缩放的高度,用百分比的形式例如100%,80%代表从高度的80%开始缩放 level=0表示不可见--><!--scaleWidth:缩放的宽度,同scaleHeight--><!--leveal为0-10000用java代码setleveal来控制当前的leveal-->
